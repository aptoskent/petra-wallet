    "staking": "Staking",
    "whatIsStaking": "What is delegated staking?",
    "whatIsStakingAnswerFirstParagraph": "Delegated staking is a feature that lets users participate in staking without becoming a validator themselves. Aptos is a proof-of-stake network which means that tokens are staked to validators in order to keep the network healthy.",
    "whatIsStakingAnswerSecondParagraph": "As an APT holder, you can ‘delegate’ your APT to a validator delegation pool. The total delegation pool is an aggregation of staked APT from various token owners, and collectively staked.",
    "whatIsStakingAnswerThirdParagraph": "When you delegate stake, you own the tokens and receive rewards on top of the staked amount. At no point does the validator have any access to your tokens as they remain securely in your control. The delegation smart contract has undergone security audit and thorough testing before launch.",
    "whatIsStakingAnswerForthParagraph": "Petra and Aptos Labs do not offer staking services and do not have access to your tokens. The staking feature in Petra allows you to connect directly with the Aptos protocol to participate in staking with the network’s validators.",
    "canAnyoneStake": "Can anyone stake APT?",
    "canAnyoneStakeAnswer": "Yes, anyone can stake APT.",
    "minimumStake": "Is there a minimum stake?",
    "minimumStakeAnswer": "11 APT is the minimum required amount to stake, but you will see a slightly lower \"staked amount\" after you complete the transaction as some APT is deducted for gas fees.",
    "howToStake": "How can I stake APT?",
    "howToStakeAnswer": "You can stake APT directly in the Petra wallet",
    "tapHereToBegin": "Tap here to begin",
    "checkOnExplorer": "You can also check your staked APT on the ",
    "explorer": "explorer page.",
    "canIUnstake": "Can I unstake my APT anytime?",
    "canIUnstakeAnswer": "You can unstake your APT at any time, but the APT will not be available until the next validator unlock date. The validator unlock period is 30 days, but the timing follows from when the delegation pool is initiated. Depending on when in the cycle you choose to unstake your APT, it could be as little as a few hours, or up to 30 days from whence you can withdraw your tokens. I.e. if you unstake 10 days into the 30 day cycle, you have to wait 20 days. If you unstake 18 days into the 30 day cycle, you have to wait 12 days. If you unstaked your tokens, and the unlock date has passed, you will be able to withdraw the tokens.",
    "whenCanIWithdraw": "When can I withdraw my APT?",
    "whenCanIWithdrawAnswerFirstParagraph": "There are two actions that you need to take: unstake and withdraw.",
    "whenCanIWithdrawAnswerSecondParagraph": "You can withdraw unstaked APT at any time as long as it is unlocked. If you have staked APT, you will have to unstake first and wait for the APT to become unlocked. At that point in time, you can then withdraw it.",
    "whenCanIWithdrawAnswerThirdParagraph": "You can see the unlock date by viewing your staked APT in Petra.",
    "whatStatusedMean": "What do these statuses mean? (Staked, Withdraw Pending, Withdraw Ready)",
    "whatStatusedMeanAnswerFirstParagraph": "Staked means the tokens are currently staked and locked up. These cannot be withdrawn until you have completed unstaking.",
    "whatStatusedMeanAnswerSecondParagraph": "Withdraw Pending means you have initiated unstaking those tokens, but they are still locked up and you have to wait for the next unlock date. The APT cannot be withdrawn until then. You can check the unlock date for the validator  you have staked with by clicking on your staked APT in Petra.",
    "whatStatusedMeanAnswerThirdParagraph": "Withdraw Ready means you can withdraw APT. When you unstake, all previously Withdraw Pending APT will be withdrawn and will be available back in your Petra wallet.",
    "addStakeFee": "What is the add stake fee?",
    "addStakeFeeAnswer": "You may see that the amount you have staked is less than the total stake you added. This is because you don’t start receiving rewards until the next epoch starts. This fee is returned at the end of the current epoch.",
    "rewards": "Rewards",
    "canValidatorChangeCommission": "Can the validator change their commission rate?",
    "canValidatorChangeCommissionAnswer": "No, the commission rate cannot be changed.",
    "stakingRewardExpectToReceive": "What staking reward can I expect to receive?",
    "stakingRewardExpectToReceiveAnswer": "Staking rewards are calculated based on the amount of APT you have staked, multiplied by the current annual rewards rate and the validator rewards performance rate, minus the validator’s commission rate.",
    "whenReceiveAward": "When do I start receiving rewards?",
    "whenReceiveAwardAnswer": "You will start receiving rewards at the beginning of the next epoch. Epochs are the rewards cycle, and are currently 2 hours.",
    "validators": "Validators",
    "whatIsValidators": "What is a validator?",
    "whatIsValidatorsAnswer": "Validator nodes confirm transactions by proposing and executing blocks on the network. The stake that they hold helps to prove that they are trusted to vote on transactions.",
    "howDoIChooseValidator": "How do I choose a validator to stake with?",
    "howDoIChooseValidatorAnswerFirstParagraph": "You can choose from the validator leaderboard on the explorer which shows the details about each validator including their performance rate and commission rate. Petra will also include some of this information during the staking workflow.",
    "howDoIChooseValidatorAnswerSecondParagraph": "Validators start receiving rewards when the delegation pool has at least 1M APT. Only active validators will receive rewards.",
    "howDoIChooseValidatorAnswerThirdParagraph": "However, please do your own research, Aptos Labs and Petra are not responsible for the veracity of the information displayed, nor responsible for the security of your funds, past or future performance of the validator node.",
    "howIsValidatorPerformanceMeasured": "How is validator performance measured?",
    "howIsValidatorPerformanceMeasuredAnswerFirstParagraph": "Validator performance rate is the percentage of rewards the validator will receive, based upon proposal success.",
    "howIsValidatorPerformanceMeasuredAnswerSecondParagraph": "It is calculated as a % of reward received by the validator out of the maximum network reward opportunity.",
