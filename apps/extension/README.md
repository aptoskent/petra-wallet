## [GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false](https://dev.to/jburroughs/don-t-use-create-react-app-until-you-know-this-1a2d)
In the `build` step in package.json I've included this to further reduce the bundle size on production builds. It removes the sourcemaps which is helpful for 
debugging in prod. By default [CRA sets it to true](https://dev.to/jburroughs/don-t-use-create-react-app-until-you-know-this-1a2d).

To include sourcemaps, run

```bash
yarn build:dev
```
