# Using the Petra Wallet

This page describes common uses of the Petra web interface. If you haven't already, install the Petra extension from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/petra-aptos-wallet/ejjladinnckdgjemekebdpeokbikhfci).

See [Install Petra Extension](https://aptos.dev/guides/install-petra-wallet-extension) for additional guidance, such as [pinning the extension](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/11190170) to make it findable by Petra button in your Chrome browser toolbar.

<Callout type="info">
  Because the Petra Wallet is browser based, you should open a dedicated browser
  window to load it and understand the wallet will lose state when you focus
  away from that window.
