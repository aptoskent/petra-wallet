# Connecting to Petra

To use Petra with your dApp, your users must first install the Petra [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/petra-aptos-wallet/ejjladinnckdgjemekebdpeokbikhfci) in their browser. Petra injects an `aptos` object into the [window](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window) of any web app the user visits.

To check if the user has installed Petra, perform the below check:

```typescript
const isPetraInstalled = window.aptos;
```

<br />
If Petra is not installed, you can prompt the user to first install Petra and provide
the below installation instructions. For example, see below:

```typescript
const getAptosWallet = () => {
  if ('aptos' in window) {
    return window.aptos;
  } else {
    window.open('https://petra.app/', `_blank`);
  }
};
```

## Installing Petra

To install Petra on your Chrome browser, download the latest stable version from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/petra-aptos-wallet/ejjladinnckdgjemekebdpeokbikhfci?hl=encategory=extensions).

## Connecting to Petra

After confirming that the web app has the `aptos` object, we can connect to Petra by calling `wallet.connect()`.

When you call `wallet.connect()`, it prompts the user to allow your web app to make additional calls to Petra, and obtains from the user basic information such as the `address` and `public key`.

See the example code below:

```typescript
const wallet = getAptosWallet();
try {
  const response = await wallet.connect();
  console.log(response); // { address: string, address: string }

  const account = await wallet.account();
  console.log(account); // { address: string, address: string }
} catch (error) {
  // { code: 4001, message: "User rejected the request."}
}
```

**NOTE**: After the user has approved the connnection for the first time, the web app's domain will be remembered for the future sessions.

## Disconnecting Petra

When you want the web app to forget about the connection status with Petra, you can do this by calling `wallet.disconnect()` in your web app. See below:

```typescript
await wallet.disconnect();
```

**NOTE**: After disconnecting, the web app must reconnect to Petra to make requests.
