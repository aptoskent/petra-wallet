# Event Listening

## onNetworkChange() and network()

A dApp may want to make sure a user is on the right network. In this case, you will need to check what network the wallet is using.

Default networks provided by the Petra wallet:

```typescript
// default networks in the wallet
enum Network {
  Testnet = 'Testnet',
  Mainnet = 'Mainnet',
  Devnet = 'Devnet',
}

// Current network
let network = await window.aptos.network();

// event listener for network changing
window.aptos.onNetworkChange((newNetwork) => {
  network = newNetwork;
});
```

## onAccountChange()

In Petra, a user may change accounts while interacting with your app. To check for these events, listen for them with: `onAccountChange`

```typescript
// get current account
let currentAccount = await window.aptos.account();

// event listener for disconnecting
window.aptos.onAccountChange((newAccount) => {
  // If the new account has already connected to your app then the newAccount will be returned
  if (newAccount) {
    currentAccount = newAccount;
  } else {
    // Otherwise you will need to ask to connect to the new account
    currentAccount = window.aptos.connect();
  }
});
```

# onDisconnect()

A user may choose to disconnect from your dApp. In that case, you will want to update your state.

```typescript
// get current connection status
let connectionStatus = await window.aptos.isConnected();

// event listener for disconnecting
window.aptos.onDisconnect(() => {
  connectionStatus = false;
});
```
