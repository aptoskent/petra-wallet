# Introduction

Petra is an interface to the [Aptos
blockchain](https://aptos.dev). Petra is a free web application
available as a [Google Chrome
extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/petra-aptos-wallet/ejjladinnckdgjemekebdpeokbikhfci)
that lets users store and transfer assets, create and view NFTs, and interact
with decentralized applications (dApps), all on the Aptos blockchain.

This developer documentation describes how to integrate Wallet into your dApp and enable your user to connect their Petra to the Aptos blockchain and complements the guidance on Aptos.dev for [installing](https://aptos.dev/guides/install-petra-wallet-extension) and [building](https://aptos.dev/guides/building-wallet-extension) the wallet extension.

The rest of the documentation describes in detail the following steps for your dApp integration:

- Checking for Petra browser extension.
- Connecting to Petra.
- Getting a user to sign, and optionally, send, a transaction to the Aptos blockchain.
- Getting a user to sign a message.
- Handling event updates from the wallet.
- Identifying error messages.
- Navigating Petra as a user.
